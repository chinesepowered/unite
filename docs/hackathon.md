1inch provides a suite of powerful tools that enable developers to build smooth DeFi experiences on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and beyond. Hackers can utilize our open-source SDKs, smart contract protocols, and robust APIs to build onchain applications. In this hackathon, we are giving builders challenges:
* Build applications with extensive use of 1inch API
* Expand the reach of 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) to one of the following EVM and non-EVM chains: Sui, Aptos, Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Doge/Litecoin, Tron, Ton, Monad, Near, Starknet, Cardano, Stellar, XRP Ledger, ICP, Tezos, Polkadot, EOS, or Cosmos.

Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and X (X being one of the chains mentioned above).
Qualification Requirements
Requirements:
- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo
Stretch goals (not hard requirements):
- UI
- Enable partial fills
- Relayer and resolver


Secondary challenge:
1inch offers a variety of REST APIs that make building onchain applications simpler. Create a full dApp using as many 1inch APIs as possible.
Example integration points:
- Add swap functionality with one of our swap protocols (1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+), Intent-based Swap (Fusion), Classic Swap, or Limit Order protocol)
- Source onchain data using our data APIs (price feeds API, wallet balances API, token metadata API, and many more)
- Post transactions our Web3 API to interact with the blockchain
